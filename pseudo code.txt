Step 1: Initialize Graph
1. Define edges → List all connections between nodes along with weights (distances).
2. Create graph `G` using MATLAB’s `graph` function.

Step 2: Get User Input                                       alogo flowchart and explain each block, blind person with a stick and map and question mark, c

   - Start node
   - Destination node
2. Find shortest path between start and destination using `shortestpath(G, startNode, endNode)`.

Step 3: Visualize Initial Graph
1. Plot the graph using the `force` layout.
2. Label edges with their weights.
3. Highlight initial shortest path in blue.

Step 4: Simulate Robot Navigation
1. Set a maximum number of blockages (`maxBlocks = 5`).
2. Initialize `blockCount = 0` to track blocked edges.
3. Start traversing the shortest path** from `startNode` to `endNode`.

Step 5: Simulate Movement and Blockages
1. For each edge in the path:
   - Highlight it in green (robot movement).
   - Pause for 1 second to simulate motion.

2. Randomly determine if a blockage appears (30% chance):
   - If a blockage occurs and an alternative path exists:
     - Remove the edge from the graph (`rmedge(G, currentNode, nextNode)`).
     - Update the graph with the new structure.
     - Increase the `blockCount`.
     - Highlight the blocked edge in red dashed lines.
     - Find a new shortest path using `shortestpath(G, startNode, endNode)`.
     - Restart traversal from the blocked node.
   - Otherwise, continue moving.

Step 6: Final Visualization
1. Display legend explaining:
   - Blue: Initial path.
   - Green: Updated path.
   - Red dashed: Blocked edges.

2. End simulation.
