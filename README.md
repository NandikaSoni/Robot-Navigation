# Robot-Navigation
This project aims to develop a dynamic pathfinding system to assist visually impaired individuals in navigating complex environments safely and efficiently. The proposed solution models the environment as an undirected, unweighted graph, where nodes represent decision points (e.g., junctions or locations) and edges represent walkable paths. Using MATLAB, the system calculates the shortest path from a user-defined starting point to a destination using Dijkstra’s algorithm. To simulate real-world conditions—such as construction zones, crowding, or sudden obstacles—the program introduces dynamic, random blockages along the route during traversal. When a path is blocked, the algorithm recalculates a new path from the current location or initiates a backtracking procedure to find an alternate safe route. This mimics how assistive navigation tools should adapt in real-time to changing environments. Visual feedback is provided for simulation and analysis purposes, with distinct colouring for original paths, rerouted paths, and blocked routes. The system highlights the potential for developing real-time, adaptable navigation aids that can be integrated into wearable technology or smartphone apps, offering visually impaired users greater autonomy and confidence in navigating public spaces.
